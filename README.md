# VoteChain
VoteChain is a Raft implementation of BlockChain, allowing for decentralized, secure, and open voting systems.
# Why?
Elections in the modern age are riddled with issues, paper voting is secure but difficult to operate, and doesn't allow for the verification of votes by the user. While electornic voting is open to hacking, and often times does not align with paper counts due to human and computer error.
# Outcome
During our 24 hour hackathon we were able to complete the basics of BlockChain, but were unable to flesh out some of the advanced bits such as Networking.
